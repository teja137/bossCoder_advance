**Binary search**

Binary search will take less time than the linear search.

Pre requisite or requirement or pre condition of binary search algorithm is, **the array should be sorted.**
If is the array is not sorted then you cannot apply binary search on it.

It is divide and conquer technique, it recursively divides the array into two halves.

Basic math of floor value is that:

floor of  -3.2 will be -4
floor of   3.2 will be 3
floor of   3 will be 3
